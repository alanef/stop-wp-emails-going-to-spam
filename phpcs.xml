        We may want a middle ground though. The best way to do this is add the
        entire ruleset, then rule by rule, remove ones that don't suit a project.
        We can do this by running `phpcs` with the '-s' flag, which allows us to
        see the names of the sniffs reporting errors.
        Once we know the sniff names, we can opt to exclude sniffs which don't
        suit our project like so.

        The below two examples just show how you can exclude rules.
        They are not intended as advice about which sniffs to exclude.
        -->
        <exclude name="WordPress.Files.FileName.NotHyphenatedLowercase"/>
        <exclude name="Generic.WhiteSpace"/>
        <exclude name="PEAR.NamingConventions"/>
        <exclude name="Universal.Files.SeparateFunctionsFromOO"/>
        <exclude name="Universal.Operators.StrictComparisons"/>
    </rule>
</ruleset>
